# BINARY CALCULATOR
CAPSTONE PROJECT OOP1

# Classes and Objects

The Binary Calculator project represents well the implementation of classes and objects. Hence my main class NunezBinaryCalculator implements the button as input, and BinaryCalculator implements the GUI and logic. All the components of the main interface are properly implemented in private fields on the BinaryCalculator class. Methods like btnFlipXActionPerformed implement specific operations with precise logic. The code shows the proper instantiation of objects and methods called on them. This makes it cleanly separation between the launcher class and the actual calculator implementation.

# Class Diagram

The class composition is basically BinaryCalculator (which extends the JFrame class), and all the UI components are private. Here is my relation showing NunezBinaryCalculator constructs an instance of BinaryCalculator. Diagram would be useful to show the relationships between different UI components, and the event handlers that they have. Methods are logically grouping by functionality - basic UI initialization, button handlers, utility methods The inheritance of JFrame is used for window functionality and composition is used for all the UI elements contained inside the calculator.

# Four OOP Principles

Encapsulation is shown by using private fields and controlled access to these fields using methods. Abstraction is shown when complex boolean operations are hiding behind simple button clicks. Inheritance is used as BinaryCalculator implements JFrame inheritance to inherit window functions, and polymorphism is shown in the implementation of action listeners where different methods structures are used for different operations and EventQueue which utilizes Runnable implementations. Each one of these principles helps to make code that is readable and organized to separate several concerns with appropriate separation of their concerns.

# Exception Handling

Exception handling is implemented in the initialization code of the UI (especially when setting up the Nimbus look and feel). The try-catch blocks manage the various possible cases like ClassNotFoundException, InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException, and UnsupportedLookAndFeelException. The method for logging of exceptions is pretty much the same as of the other, standard java. util. logging framework. However it's possible to add some extra exception handling to the core logical operations, be it for unexplained states in the input stream or parsing errors.

# File Handling

The current implementation is not very good at handling files. In order to extend the functionality some methods could be added that could save state of calculator and history of operations to files. This would require implementing serialization of calculator states, creating file input/output operations, and adding UI elements to trigger save/load operations. Saving persisting data would allow users to continue working in multiple sessions and preserve recording of important calculations for reference later.

# Graphical User Interface

The GUI implementation uses a very organized layout of components. Fields which input values of X and Y are displayed with their flip buttons. The buttons of operation are separated and have clear labelling. The result display is clearly visible. All interaction forms (call and print) are implemented using the addButtonPressEffect method thereby providing recognizable interactions for the user. The layout of the interface is meticulously spaced, aligned and sized to present an appealing and professional interface.

# Additions

A number of other things could be added: a calculation history panel. More complex boolean expressions (more than 2 variables) on can be used, the presence of a truth table generator (for use in education), keyboard shortcuts for faster operation, user tooltips explaining logical operations, user custom themes or color schemes. Binary representations with boolean values can also be displayed. Undo/redo functionality could also be added for operation sequences.
